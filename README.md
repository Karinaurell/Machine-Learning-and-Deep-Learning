# Machine-Learning-and-Deep-Learning
Machine Learning and Deep Learning are two major sub-fields within Artificial Intelligence (AI) that focus on the ability of computers to learn from data and make decisions or predictions. Although closely related, they have different approaches, algorithms and applications.

Case 1 Predicting Customer Churn in Banking Using Machine Learning Models

To predict customer churn status in the banking sector. By utilising historical data from customers, three different machine learning models were developed and compared to determine the best model. By completing and comparing the three different models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Deep Neural Network), it was concluded that DNN is the best model to predict banking customer churn. The use of model optimisation techniques, such as hyperparameter tuning and feature selection, helped to strengthen the overall performance of the model.

Case 2 House Price Prediction Using Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) with TensorFlow

Determining the optimal number of clusters from a set of random data points using clustering techniques is often an important part of exploratory data analysis in machine learning and deep learning. Clustering algorithms help discover patterns or groups within data in the absence of predefined labels or categories. This project successfully determined that 3 clusters was the optimal number for this randomised data. Clustering and evaluation techniques such as Elbow and Silhouette help in finding patterns in the data without labels, while cluster visualisation helps in understanding the distribution of data and validation of clustering results.

Case 3 Determining the Optimal Number of Clusters on Random Data Using Clustering Algorithms

To predict house prices using a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) based deep learning model. MLP is an artificial neural network suitable for regression problems, such as house price prediction, because it can capture complex relationships between features through various hidden layers.
This project shows that the Multilayer Perceptron model can be used to accurately predict house prices with sufficient data and proper feature preparation. The model shows good performance in capturing non-linear patterns among house price features. The process of parameter optimisation and tuning is essential to achieve the best results. Thus, MLP is an effective approach to the regression problem in property price prediction.

Case 4 Credit Card Fraud Classification with Multilayer Perceptron

This project aims to detect credit card fraud transactions using Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) based Deep Learning techniques. Such classification is a challenging case as the data is highly imbalanced, where legitimate transactions far outnumber fraudulent transactions. This project shows that Multilayer Perceptron with proper customisation is an effective model for credit card fraud classification. The MLP model shows good performance in detecting fraudulent transactions on unbalanced data. Data balancing and parameter optimisation techniques play an important role in achieving high Recall and F1-Score rates, making MLP a promising solution in credit card fraud detection applications.
